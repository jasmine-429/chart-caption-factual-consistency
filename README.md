# Chart Caption Factual Consistency

This repository contains the code for the MSc thesis:

**Factual Inconsistency in Chart Captioning: Error Analysis and Two-Stage Fine-Tuning for MLLMs**

## Overview
We study factual inconsistency in chart captioning and propose a two-stage fine-tuning framework:
1. **Stage 1:** Factual consistency detection
2. **Stage 2:** Chart caption generation

The framework aims to improve both linguistic fluency and factual correctness of generated chart descriptions.
